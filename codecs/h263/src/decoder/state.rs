    /// 1. A reader is semantically related to a previously-used reader if a
    ///    successful read of the previous reader would have yielded the same
    ///    bits as a read on the current one.
    /// 2. A reader remains semantically related to a previously-used reader if
    ///    unsuccessful reads of the previous reader are successful in the new
    ///    reader and the resulting additional bitstream correctly forms a
    ///    syntactically and semantically valid bitstream for this decoder.
    ///
    /// In practice, this means that streaming additional bits into the reader
    /// is OK, but seeking the reader to a new position is not. In order to
    /// seek to a new position, you must discard all existing decoder state,
    /// then seek to the position of a valid I frame and begin decoding anew.

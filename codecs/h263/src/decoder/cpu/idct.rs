/// Given a list of reconstructed IDCT levels, transform it out of the

///
/// The input of this function, `block_levels`, is an arbitrarily-sized block of
/// decompressed, dezigzagged transform coefficients in row-major (x + y*8)
/// order. It must have a width equal to `samples_per_line` and dimensions
/// divisible by 8.
///
/// The `output` of this IDCT is represented as an arbitrarily-sized list of
/// `u8`s, also in row-major order and formatted in the same way as
/// `block_levels`. If this is an INTER block and predicted pixel data already
/// exists from the motion compensation step, you should pre-initialize the
/// output array with the result of said step so that the IDCT and summation
/// step can happen simultaneously. Otherwise, you should provide an array of
/// zeroes.
